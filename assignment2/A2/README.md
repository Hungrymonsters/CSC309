Tap Tap Bug - Webbased Game

Description of the Project:
There are insects and food on the screen, user wants to kill the insects (by tapping them) to preventing them from eating the food. Goal is to achive the highest score. There are two levels, the insects in the 2 level walk faster accross the screen, which increase the diffculty. Duration of each game is a minute.

Programming language used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (tested on Google Chrome)

Cooperated with the team of 2 to designed and implimented the game. We encountered some problems, such as the timer count down; difficulty of resizing the images; smooth transection between pages. And we managed resolve them, and successfully implemented the second level. 
Hence, some father modification can be done to refine the result, such as the direction of movement of the insects; the animation of the insects when exiting the screen.
From this project, I learnt to implement JavaScript with HTML; cooperated with my team to solve problem efficiently; demonstrated the project to TA and professors.
